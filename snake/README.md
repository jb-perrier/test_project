# Snake

A small standalone Rust terminal Snake game for Story `ST-00004`.

## Run

- `cargo run --manifest-path snake/Cargo.toml`

## Test

- `cargo test --manifest-path snake/Cargo.toml`

## Controls

- `Enter` or `Space`: start from the ready screen
- Arrow keys or `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`: move the snake
- `R`, `Enter`, or `Space`: restart after game over
- `Q` or `Esc`: quit

## Notes

- The UI uses `ratatui` for a compact board-first terminal layout and keeps `crossterm` for input handling.
- A single-line HUD keeps score, tick speed, and phase visible while giving more terminal space to the board.
- The board uses larger cells, and phase-specific control guidance stays visible below the playfield.
- A new run places the player snake, one AI enemy snake, and shared food on distinct cells.
- The player and enemy remain visible in ready, running, and game-over states, with distinct head/body colors for each snake.
- The enemy moves every running tick, follows the same wraparound movement rules as the player, prefers moving toward food, and falls back to another safe direction when needed.
- Food never spawns on either snake.
- Player-only food increases score and speeds up the tick rate until the existing minimum floor.
- If the enemy eats the shared food, it grows and a new food item spawns without changing player score or speed.
- Fatal collisions involving either snake, including self-collision, head-to-head contact, and player-to-enemy overlap, end the run through the existing game-over phase.
- If the terminal is too small for the compact layout, the game shows a resize message.
- The crate is intentionally isolated under `snake/` and does not modify the existing JS/TS workspace.
